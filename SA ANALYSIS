**Shark Attacks – Power BI Dashboard**

**Overview**
This project analyzes global **shark attack incidents** from the Shark Attacks dataset.  
The dashboard shows overall attack numbers, fatality rates, risk by activity, and species involved.  
It helps shift the story from fear to facts.

**Key Insights**
**Fatality rate is low** – most shark attacks are survivable.  
**Top 3 countries**: USA, Australia, South Africa.  
**Most common activities**: Surfing and swimming.  
**Victims**: Mostly male
**Species**: White sharks and Tiger sharks appear most often, but many cases list “Unknown.”  
**Trend**: Reported cases rise over time, due to more people in the water and better reporting.  

**Risks**
- Tourism industries face image risks after fatal events.  
- Public safety depends on patrol readiness and first-aid access.  
- Data quality is patchy: many “Unknown species” entries.  

**Recommendations**
1. Targeted safety campaigns for surfers and swimmers.  
2. Deploy rescue resources in top attack regions.  
3. Improve species identification in reporting.  
4. Train coastal patrols in rapid response to reduce fatalities.
