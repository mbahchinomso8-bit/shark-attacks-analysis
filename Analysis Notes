**Analysis Notes – Shark Attacks**

**Dataset**
- File: Shark attacks.xlsx  
- Sheet: attacks  
- Columns include: Case Number, Year, Type, Country, Area, Location, Activity, Sex, Age, Injury, Fatal (Y/N), Time, Species  

**Cleaning steps (Power Query)**
1. Remove empty rows.  
2. Keep only the first Case Number column (delete duplicates like Case Number.1, Case Number.2).  
3. Fix casing in Country, Area, Location, Activity (Capitalize Each Word).  
4. Set Year and Age as Whole Numbers.  
5. Standardize values:  
   - Sex → only `M`, `F`, `Unknown`.  
   - Fatal (Y/N) → only `Y` or `N` (blank = N).  
   - Type → only `Unprovoked`, `Provoked`, `Boat`, `Unknown`.  

**DAX measures (for cards)**
Total Attacks = COUNTROWS('attacks')

Fatal Attacks =
CALCULATE([Total Attacks], TRIM('attacks'[Fatal (Y/N)]) = "Y")

Fatality Rate % =
DIVIDE([Fatal Attacks], [Total Attacks], 0)

Average Age = AVERAGE('attacks'[Age])
